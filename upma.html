            Saute for a minute. Now add mustard seeds and let them splutter. 
            Now add urad dal and fry it for a few minutes.
            <li>Saute the veggies</li>
            Now add chopped onion and let them cook until translucent. 
            Add chopped carrot and cook it for a few minutes.

            Add the rava and roast it for a few minutes.
             Now add water, salt and continuously stir the mixture. 
             Once it starts thickening, keep the flame medium and stir it.

             Once the rava absorbs all the water and the upma becomes thick, 
             it is ready to be served. Enjoy it with coconut chutney.
